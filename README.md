### Katafanga - Python implementation of AlphaZero
This repository hosts the source code that served as the submission for our Bachelor Thesis at the IT-University of Copenhagen
in spring 2019. The point of this thesis was to implement a functioning version of Google DeepMind's *AlphaZero*, and to
have such an implementation train, and perform well, on consumer-grade hardware.
